# Countries-API-App-with-Mapkit
This iOS app calls the countries API.  Then parses the JSON to populate the master TableView with names and the detail View the country details including the location on glob on the map
The detail view also has a button that opens the browser to show the flag image of the country.  Swift4 has simplified the encoding and decoding of JSON.  Decoding is now reduced to one line code.
